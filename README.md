## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* A free API key from **[Finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io)**

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or simply download the `api.py`, `portfolio.py`, and `main.py` files into a new directory).

2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file** in your project directory with the following content:
    ```
    typer[all]>=0.9.0
    finnhub-python>=2.4.0
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages** by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your Finnhub API Key**
    This tool requires a Finnhub API key to fetch stock data. You must store this key in an environment variable named **`FINNHUB_API_KEY`**.

    **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    export FINNHUB_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *(To make this permanent, add the line above to your shell's startup file, such as `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, then restart your terminal.)*

    **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
    setx FINNHUB_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *(You will need to close and reopen your terminal for this change to take effect.)*
