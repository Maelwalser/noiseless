ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

A free API key from Finnhub.io

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository (or simply download the api.py, portfolio.py, and main.py files into a new directory).

Create a requirements.txt file in your project directory with the following content:

typer[all]>=0.9.0
finnhub-python>=2.4.0
Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Finnhub API Key
This tool requires a Finnhub API key to fetch stock data. You must store this key in an environment variable named FINNHUB_API_KEY.

On macOS/Linux:

Bash

export FINNHUB_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
(To make this permanent, add the line above to your shell's startup file, such as ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc, then restart your terminal.)

On Windows (Command Prompt):

DOS

setx FINNHUB_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
(You will need to close and reopen your terminal for this change to take effect.)

ðŸ’» Commands & Usage
All commands are run from your terminal.
